# minify-and-optimize-code

This script helps in removing extra lines and whitespaces to shrink and optimize the code. Just change the file path to the file you want to minify and place an empty file of same extension so it writes the contents there. The placed empty file will have the desired optimized code on running the python script.

  
## To Run
  
`python3 optimize.py`
